              <p>You are someone who loves building software that people genuinely love using.  You want to make things that excite people. That add joy to their daily lives.  And you want to do it with people who are working towards a common goal and see your success as their success.  You will be joining a team that values getting things done, helping others get things done, and building towards an amazing future.</p>
              <p>Our customers are Designers and Engineers who care about the details; the small stuff.  Every bit of the customer experience is important and weâ€™re not just talking about features.  Every bit of friction is something that gets in the way of creativity and innovation.  Our job is to foster both of those things.</p>
              <p>You like to go really deep because you love to unravel things, both to understand how they work and to use them beyond what others thought was possible.  You love both new and interesting things but also things that are proven to work because youâ€™ve been burned by the new and shiny before.  You arenâ€™t afraid to tackle any problem head on with the support of talented people to help.  You enable people to do their best and achieve things together they never thought possible.  Because you care.  Because you genuinely want to deliver something that people love.</p>
